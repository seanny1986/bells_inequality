Monte Carlo simulation of a Bell test with hidden variables. This script keeps track of the bound established by Bell's inequality, and generates the associated correlation plot of two entangled particles with a hidden spin variable. This correlation function is plotted against the theoretical correlation we expect to see from QM, and a Monte Carlo estimate generated using the detection loophole (rejection sampling at the detectors with a probability of rejection taken from Pearle, 1970).
